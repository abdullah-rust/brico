# 🏗️ Constructo-App | Smart Construction Suite

Constructo-App is a high-performance, mobile-first web application designed to bridge the gap between construction professionals and homeowners. Built with a focus on custom optimized architecture to ensure a seamless "native-app" feel on the web.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Design Gallery:** A high-performance Masonry layout showcasing architectural designs (Modern, Spanish, etc.).
- **Professional Discovery:** Smart filtering system to find verified masons, electricians, and plumbers near you.
- **Construction Toolset:** Real-time engineering calculators including Cost Estimators, Area Calculators, and Material Estimators.
- **Secure Authentication:** Enterprise-grade JWT architecture featuring custom **Axios Interceptors** for silent, multi-request token refreshing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Engineered for scalability and speed:

- **Frontend:** React.js (TypeScript) for robust type safety.
- **Styling:** CSS Modules for component-scoped, maintainable styling.
- **Backend:** Node.js & Express.js for a lightweight, high-speed API.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Primary Data) & Redis (High-speed Caching).
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized environment, Caddy (Reverse Proxy), and AWS S3 for media storage.
- **Middleware:** Advanced custom Axios logic for optimized request/response handling.

## 📦 Current Status

The project is currently in the **active development phase**. The core UI/UX framework and authentication systems are fully functional. Beta release with live calculators is expected soon.

> **Developer's Note:** This project represents a passion for custom-built, optimized software systems. As a self-taught engineer, I focus on building architectures from the ground up rather than relying on standard cookie-cutter templates.
